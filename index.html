              <p>Over the years, Nigerians, regardless of where they are domiciled, have earned a unique reputation for celebrating events in truly distinct fashion. Apart from gracing such occasions decked in brilliant and eye-catching outfits, the people have stopped at nothing to roll out the drums at such periods, with tasty meals and assorted drinks to complement usually in the line up. The celebration comes in different forms and colour, in fact.</p>

            <p>However, in recent times, with the advent of the social media occasioned by the rise of information communication technology, the trend appears to have changed, taking new and unimaginable turns by the day.</p>

            <p>For example, earlier in the week, Nigerian Internet users were stunned by the video and photographs of a young lady washing her hands and feet with bottles of a popular brand of champagne. According to reports, the lady, who was said to have recently graduated from a university in the country, celebrated the feat by popping over 100 bottles of the drink said to cost at least N3, 000 each in the open market. Known with the handle name qualitybeddingnigeria on Instagram, a social networking platform, the lady is said to be from a wealthy home. The video and photographs attracted large views and divergent comments from members of the public.</p>

               <span style="color: black;">But unbelievable as it sounds, it is not the first time individual as would be adopting 'bizarre' measures to celebrate an occasion in Nigeria today.</span>

            <p>Two weeks ago, photographs of a student of the Nnamdi Azikwe University, Awka, Anambra State, known as Ifeanyi Ubah surfaced online; gripping viewers with shock and surprise. The young man was captured rolling inside mud water and eating bread and bean cake known as akara in local parlance as friends celebrated his graduation from the institution.</p>

            <p>One of his buddies, Benedict Ejikeme, who wrote a caption along with the photos in a Facebook post, said that the ‘humiliating treatment’ was the best gift they could give him on such momentous occasion.</p>

            <p>“The joy of university days is complete when you graduate alive, hale and hearty. We went down to celebrate with my own person in the person of Comrade Ifeanyi Ubah, Emeritus President of the Department of Cooperative Economics, Unizik, as he drops his pen today. Congrats brother. We can’t celebrate you any better than this,” he said.</p>

            <p>Perhaps a more hilarious version of the new trend in celebration among Nigerians played out in North in March 2017 when a die-hard supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari bought and distributed dried spiced meat known as Kilishi in local parlance worth N200, 000 to people to mark the arrival of the Nigerian leader, who had been away on medical vacation in the United Kingdom for 51 days.</p>

            <p>The excited man, whose name was not mentioned, would have a place in the history books as far as this type of ‘weird’ behaviour is concerned.</p>

            <p>Two months before that time it was the photograph of a young man named Jibola and his mother being drenched with water by his friends during his graduation ceremony from the university that made the rounds on the Internet. The young man, decked in suit and pants, held tightly to his mother excitedly as the ‘artificial rain’ from his friends came down on them. It was a sight that attracted all sorts of reactions from online users.</p>

            <p>In November 2016, photographs of three young women rolling in mud water while their friends pelted them with raw eggs and tomatoes emerged online as well. The ladies, like several others, had just graduated from the university and so for them and their friends, it was the best time to enact one of the ‘craziest celebrations’ ever seen. As part of the ‘special treatment’ from their friends, the young women were also drenched with water and forced to roll in it. Not many found the sight amusing.</p>

            <p>That same month in Benin, Edo State, another sight capable of sending chill down the spine of many played out at a popular night club in the city when images of several young men washing their hands and heads with expensive bottles of champagne hit the Internet. Dubbed ‘showers of blessing’, the act is not just a show of class and wealth by the actors but also a way of warding off poverty, according to their claims. A bottle of the particular drink they ‘wasted’ cost around N18, 000 at the club. The guys were said to have bought around 20 units of the champagne for the ‘bizarre’ celebration.</p>

            <p>In August 2016, the trend took another twist when a video showing three young men pouring several bottles of expensive champagne on a new car a friend had just bought went viral on the Internet. According to them, they were “washing away bad luck, accident and other evil things”.</p>

            <p>But amusing and thrilling as these ‘weird’ acts are and or intended to be, some, rather than attracting applause from members of the public and give actors a feeling of satisfaction, have instead ended in tragedy, leaving many scarred for life.</p>

            <p>For instance, on March 29, 2017, a 14-year-old girl named Victoria Emmanuel was mistakenly bathed with acid by her young friends, who, following in the footsteps of the older ones, wanted to give her one of the most unforgettable birthday celebrations ever. While many of them splashed buckets of water on her, one of them – Moshood Yusuf – a 13-year-old, poured something more dreadful on Emmanuel. In the midst of the excitement, the teenager had stormed into a nearby shop belonging to a woman, grabbed a bottle containing liquid and emptied its content on her. But he miscalculated. What he thought was water or at most alcoholic drink, turned out to be a deadly chemical. The 14-year-old girl, who resides in the Mafoluku area of Oshodi, a Lagos suburb, with her parents, lives with the scars.</p>
